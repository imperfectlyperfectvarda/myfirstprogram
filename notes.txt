a is a tag(like body) jo sabse pehle likha jata hai vo tag hai
href : is an attribute, attribute gives a new quality to tag
meta : is a tag

example of internal file linking: <a href="/tut4.html" target="_blank">tut4 </a>

for adding images:
img tag
src: means source
alt: what to display if image is not loaded.

source.unsplash.com
<img src="https://source.unsplash.com/200x400/?nature,water" alt="remote image"> : you can resize the image by giving dimensions.widthxheight
width="233" height="34": not recommended to set like this

ul :unordered list, will have bullet points or any other shape also: disc , square, circle etc.eg: <ul type="square">
ol: ordered list, will have serial no.
ol type="1" , "i": eg. <ol type="i">

we can have lists under lists.
rightclick and click format document: we get the formatted and aligned text


Table:
example-

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>name</th>
                <th>employeeid</th>
                <th>employee role</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>harry</td>
                <td>21</td>
                <td>programmer</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>

    </table>

tr:row

FORMS AND INPUT TAGS:
Action is the endpoint where all the data from the form gets submitted.
div tag: used to bring a division- we used div for it to be in next line
name is the way backend will know.
Submit now:
<div>
    <input type="submit" value="Submit Now">
</div>
Rest now can also be done similarly
to add date: 
<div>
   date:  <input type="date" name="myDate" >
</div>

for checkbox:
<div>
    are you eligible?:  <input type="checkbox" name="myEligibility" >
 </div>
for Radio button:you can only select 1 because both have 1 name myGender
 <div>

Textarea: for taking paragraph as input
 <div>
     Write about yourself : <textarea name="mytext" cols="30" rows="10"></textarea>
 </div>
    Gender: Male <input type="radio" name="myGender" >  FeMale <input type="radio" name="myGender" >
 </div>

if you want by default something should be checked then use checked.

Label:
agr name pr click kia to box me apneaap chala jayega.(jo for me denge wahi same id me hona chahiye)
       <label for="name">Name</label>
<div>
    <input type="text" name="myName" id="name">
</div>

Select:(to give choice)
eg:
    <label for="car">Car</label>
    <select name="myCar" id="car">
    <option value="ind" selected>Indica</option>
    <option value="swf">Swift</option>
    </select>

selected is used to have the option selected

Paragraph is a block element it takes all the width.take up the entire space. eg. div, paragraph,li
But if we use span instead of paragraph tag then it comes in a single line , it s an inline element.take only their space. eg.span,anchor(a),em, (img) 

Strong is used to bold the text

id=identifier which you can identify by this name. In 1 page only 1 id should be there.
eg.:<div id="mainBox" class="redBg">
class= the element which is give class, in that element all those properties will come.
One element can have just one id.And one id can only be there in just one element.But this is not the case for classes.
i can give multiple class to one element and i can add one class to multiple elements. In one element multiple class can be there,one class can be in multiple elements.


Select and press ctrl+/ to comment
dot(.) is for class and # is for id. example: element.___ 

emment takes div tag as default. eg.: .__ so it will come with div

Creating multiple elements using Emment:
span.myclass.myclass2.myclass3 + <Tab>


HTML ENTITIES:html reserved characters,to write characters which are not there in keyborad or special characters

html by default chops of all the extra spaces
&lt;p&gt; to write <p>
&nbsp;: gives the space
<p>copyright paragrapgn is writen &copy;</p>: for copyright
&pound; : for pound symbol
for other examples take entities from chart
<p>empty character is writen &#8203;</p>

SEMANTICS TAGS: 
Semantics :the meaning of semantics is the meaning, that is, to give meaning to any one word
eg. header-always on top,footer, details(can be collapsed and expanded), summary(jo ander aayega vo pura display hoga)
nav: ex preview, navigation bar it doesnt have content

Non-semantic elements: which do not tell what their work is in the website
example: div,span


CSS:
gives style to raw HTML.
used to make websites responsive
takes responsibility of design
Cascading Style Sheets

p {color:blue;} 
p:selector - where? where is it going to change
color:property- this
blue:value- set this value

Markup: HTML Code ka fancy name

Inline CSS: meaning we put it in the same element as this CSS and whatever is there our styling gets added to that element.
Internal CSS: to remove the markup,put a style tag inside the head; markup of all the pages within the same page but in different tags, in one place in the same page.
eg.:<style>
       p{
          color:blueviolet;
          background-color:aqua ;
       }
    </style>
External CSS: means create a separate file,create a separate .CSS file,add all CSS to it and will include in our markup.
             Step 1: write CSS in .CSS file
             Step 2: include that CSS file to markup
eg.:<link rel="stylesheet" href="varda.css">
The priority of inline css is more over internal css

If you wrote any CSS afterwards it will take precedence. 
so the thing which is written afterwards will take more order.(jo cheez baad me likhi hai vo ho jayegi): internal aur external me se.
(for background color)pr 
!important using this will make that line important.

CSS SELECTORS:
it helps to select the markup
helps you to target the elements which you have to select
used to target the html elements (in the markup)

Types of selectors:
just p is element selector
id selector use #for id and give same name as id
Class selector can be used for class also by using . 
combined or grouping selector:
id is identifier and its unique
Use idselector when you are dealing with one element.
Use class when we need to put same thing to all the elements.

for comment in CSS:
/*____*/ (inside style)
